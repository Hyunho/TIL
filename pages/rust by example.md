- macro rules!
	- > Rust provides a powerful macro system that allows metaprogramming.
	- > macros are expanded into source code that gets compiled with the rest of the program.
	- > Rust macros are expanded into abstract syntax trees, rather than string preprocessing, so you don't get unexpected precedence bugs.
	- Designators
		- > The arguments of a macro are prefixed by a dollar sign $ and type annotated with a designator:
		- block
		- expr
